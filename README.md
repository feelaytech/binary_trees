# C Binary trees
In this project, I learnt a new concept in C programming language Data Structures and Algorithms: **Binary Trees**. The concepts here included types of Binary Trees, Operations involved in Binary trees, including binary Search, tree traversal, deletion, insertion and the respective code implementation of each of them.
I also learnt the various Big O notations of the time complexities of the operations of BSTs, AVL trees and Binary Heaps.
