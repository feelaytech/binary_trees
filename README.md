# C Binary trees
In this project, I learnt a new concept in C programming language Data Structures and Algorithms: **Binary Trees**. 

The concepts here included:

- **Types of Binary Trees such as:**
  - Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
  - AVL Trees
  - Max Binary Heaps
- **Operations involved in Binary trees such as:**
  - Declaration and creation
  - Binary Search
  - Tree traversal
  - Deletion
  - Insertion
  - Left and Right Rotation
  - Conversion of array to binary trees
- **Code implementation of each of the bynary tree types and their operations**

I also learnt the various Big O notations of the time complexities of the operations of BSTs, AVL trees and Binary Heaps.
